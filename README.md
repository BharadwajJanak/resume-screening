##  Project Overview

This is an **end-to-end Resume Screening Machine Learning project**. The goal is to **automatically classify resumes into job categories** using **Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit**.  

The project consists of:
- **Data preprocessing & cleaning**
- **TF-IDF feature extraction**
- **Multi-class classification using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and KNN**
- **Visualization of resume categories and keywords**
- **Interactive Streamlit web app** for real-time predictions

This project is designed to demonstrate **real-world ML workflow** for recruitment automation.
